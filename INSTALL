To compile, type
	./bootstrap
	./configure
	make

Then to install, type
	make install

If you don't want the files installed to /usr/local/bin, then you can
specify --prefix=/usr or some other dir as a parameter to configure.

* Useful options to configure:

These options may be used to restore behaviour that was built into older
versions of DVDAuthor.

	--enable-default-video-format=NTSC
	--enable-default-video-format=PAL

Without one of these, there is no hard-coded default video format.
(Of course, a user- or system-specified default always takes precedence
if present.)

	--enable-localize-filenames

Specify this if you want filenames to be interpreted according to your
locale setting. Without this, filenames are assumed to be in UTF-8
encoding.
